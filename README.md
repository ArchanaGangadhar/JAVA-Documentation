### Other important terminologies in Java World:

- Servlet: These are java programs that process the request obtained from the web server, process the request, and send the response back to the web server. [Click here for more info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-java-servlets/)

- JSP: (Java server pages) 

- Apache Tomcat: It is a web server and a servlet/JSP container. 

- Difference betweeen Apache and Tomcat: Apache Tomcat is used to deploy your java servlet and JSP. In Java project you can build your war file and drop it in deploy directory of Tomcat. So basically Apache is an http server serving http, while tomcat is servlet and jsp serving java technology.

- Package: It is a mechanism in Java to encapsulate the classes, subpackages and interfaces. If a package name is college.staff.cse, then there are three directories, college, staff and cse such that cse is present in staff and staff is present in college. Also, the directory college is accessible through CLASSPATH variable.This makes sure that the classes are easy to locate. Packages are named in reverse order of domain names, i.e., org.geeksforgeeks.practice. For example, in a college, the recommended convention is college.tech.cse, college.tech.ee, college.art.history, etc.

- Examples of Built-In Packages:
  1) java.lang: Contains language support classes (e.g classed which defines primitive data types, math operations). This package is automatically imported.
  2)  java.io: Contains classed for supporting input / output operations.
  3)  java.util: Contains utility classes which implement data structures like Linked List, Dictionary and support ; for Date/Time operations.
  4)  java.applet: Contains classes for creating Applets.
  5)  java.awt: Contain classes for implementing the components for graphical user interfaces (like button , ;menus etc).
  6)  java.net: Contain classes for supporting networking operations.
